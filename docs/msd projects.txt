Setup local development environment
===========================================================
1. Setup JDK/Maven/Python
2. For maven it's necessary to setup repositories and mirrors. Here
   https://share.merck.com/display/BP/Local+development+configuration+for+Maven
   is info about set up local maven instance (download and setup settings.xml)


Setup tunnel using msd pc/virtual machine
===========================================================
1.  Install Oracle VirtualBox and install virtual linux machine (usually - Ubuntu Server)
2.  Set up two network interfaces for virtual machine - "Bridged Network" and "NAT"
3.  Assure that virtual machine has two ip addresses - one for NAT, one for local (external) network.
    Check ip's with command: [ip a]
    In case one of adapters couldn't get local (external) network ip load dhcp client [sudo dhclient] and check ip's again.
    It's important to have both ips assigned (NAT is used as an exit to msd network, local (external) is used as an entrance 
    for external pcs).
4a. Try to ping virtual machine from external pc - by local network ip. If it is OK - go ahead, if not - solve the issue.
4b. In case of issues or if network interfaces don't automatically get ip addresses (dhcp client doesn't start automatically),

5.  Turn on/login to vpn network on msd pc.
6a. For external windows PC:
    * install putty
	* create connection to virtual machine on msd pc (don't open it now):
	  ip from point 4 (that you've pinged) and usually port 22
	* for connection go to: Connection -> SSH -> Tunnels and create tunnel
	   - type: local
	   - source port: 3180 (usually 3180, but you may get any)
       - destination: 54.40.192.193:8080 (msd proxy server address/ip and port)
6b. For external linux pc:
    * create tunnel using command ssh -L 3180:54.40.192.193:8080 login@bridge_ip
7. On external PC install additional web-browser (or use default one) and setup proxy on it. For example, you may use Firefox:
    * install Firefox
	* install FoxyProxy extension
	* setup proxy on local host 127.0.0.1/localhost and port 3180 (or on that port, that you've set proxy on)
	* use url pattern *merck.com*


Building/deployment
===========================================================
builds.merck.com - Jenkins build server for deploy etc.

path: projects->mantis


Cluster
===========================================================
DEV edge nodes:
mantis-01.bdpdev.gin.merck.com:22
mantis-02.bdpdev.gin.merck.com:22


Stash repositories
===========================================================
[mantis-ops] - devops repository, Jenkins jobs etc.


Personal deployment
===========================================================
Personal deployment deploys mantis pipeline (test pipeline) to your own space (dir) on a mantis edge node.
Jenkuns job is located here:
https://builds.merck.com/job/PROJECTS/job/MANTIS/job/DEPLOY/job/Deploy%20mantis%20to%20environment%20personal%20dev/

How to use it: 
1. Before first use (personal deployment) or if you want to renew your artifact (after merge to develop, 
   other changes, etc.) you have to run jenkins job:
   
   https://builds.merck.com/job/PROJECTS/job/MANTIS/job/MANTIS-REPOSITORY/job/MAN-MANTIS-BDS/job/man-mantis-bds-custom_artifact/
   
   it builds your custom artifact and put it in nexus.
   path: projects->mantis->mantis-repository->man-mantis-bds->man-mantis-bds-custom_artifact
   
2.
