                  Assignment #2
=========================================================
(+) Part 1.

Play with HDFS service (reproduce and play with all the
commands, features, modes of HDFS Service from presentation).

Attach at least three screenshots #1 #2 #3 with different situations.

Part 2.

(+) Download the data set form http://goo.gl/lwgoxw
Data set description see here: http://contest.ipinyou.com/data.shtml

(+) Unzip these files and put them in HDFS system:
 o bid.20130606.txt.bz2
 o bid.20130607.txt.bz2
 o bid.20130608.txt.bz2
 o bid.20130609.txt.bz2
 o bid.20130610.txt.bz2
 o bid.20130611.txt.bz2
 o bid.20130612.txt.bz2
Make screenshot #4 with imported in HDFS files

Count amount of records for each iPinyou ID from all these
files, sort in a DESC order, write TOP-100 result into
bid_result.txt file on HDFS system (use for this only HDFS API
and plain java (scala), no MR paradigm, no Hive, no Spark.

Measure the whole process time, memory consumptions, others
resources utilization;

Try to optimize JVM, GC parameters, like:
--Xms8g --Xmx8g --Xmn2g  -XX:PermSize=64M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M
-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:+UseG1GC
-XX:NewSize=4g -XX:MaxNewSize=5g -XX:ConcGCThreads -XX:+UseStringDeduplication
or other for Java 8 (repeat previous measurements and provide your results
with your keys).

Prepare performance report in Excel for last two points and attach to
homework results.

In Hadoop HW 2 should be
•	4 screenshots
•	performance report (more than 10 experiments with different settings)
•	bid_result.txt
•	your code/shell command for counting task
